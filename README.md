This report analyzes FAA wildlife strike data from 1990 to 1997 using complete cases with non-missing values for key variables like altitude, speed, and flight phase. Both Bayesian and frequentist methods are applied to provide reliable estimates and intervals. The results should be interpreted carefully, as the data is observational and cannot show cause-and-effect relationships.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6dc9b7b-b250-442c-864b-fcf2070153a9)
